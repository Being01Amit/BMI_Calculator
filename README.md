# BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator Android app developed using Kotlin. The app calculates BMI based on user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). It also provides a BMI category based on the calculated BMI.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation**: The app calculates BMI using the standard formula: weight (kg) / height (m)^2.
- **BMI Category**: Based on the calculated BMI, the app provides a category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese).
- **Error Handling**: The app checks for empty fields and invalid input (e.g., weight <= 0, height <= 0).
- **Unit Conversion**: The app supports both metric (kg/m) and imperial (lb/in) units for weight and height.
